# Pentecenter Trade Booster (Anno 117: Pax Romana)

## Overview
This mod focuses exclusively on buffing the civilian Pentecenter (GUID 37222) to excel as a fast, durable trade shuttle. Other Roman ships remain untouched (vanilla stats).

## Current Pentecenter Stats (Modified)
- Cargo Slots: 9 (high throughput)
- Base Speed: 24.0 (extreme speed for rapid route cycling)
- Acceleration: 2 / Deceleration: 1.5
- Rotation Speed: 60 (agile turns)
- Module Slots: 2 (standard customization retained)
- Health: 4000 (reinforced to survive incidental attacks)
- Build Time: 10 seconds (rapid deployment)

These values are intentionally powerful for trade convenience. If performance feels unbalanced in your playthrough, you may manually lower speed or cargo in `assets.xml`.

## Installation
1. Locate your Anno 117 mods folder: `Documents/Anno 117/mods/`
2. Copy the entire `super-ships` folder into the mods directory
3. Launch Anno 117
4. Ensure the mod is active in the Mod Manager (if present)
5. Build new Pentecenters (existing ships keep old stats)

## Unchanged Content
- Trireme (37223): Vanilla
- Quinquireme (37224): Vanilla
- Asset pools and advanced cost/maintenance structures are not modified.

```

## Balance & Notes
- Speed 24.0 is far above normal; retained per original user request.
- High health (4000) ensures survival during trade routes without making the ship offensive.
- Low build time enables quick fleet scaling early.
- No changes to costs, upkeep, or other ships to minimize side effects.

## Adjusting Values (Optional)
Edit `assets.xml` and change properties under the single `<ModOp>` blocks for GUID 37222. Example: lower `<BaseSpeed>` or `<SlotCount>` for a more balanced experience.

## Troubleshooting
- No effect? Ensure you built a new Pentecenter after enabling the mod.
- XML error? Validate closing tags and GUID quotes.
- Overpowered feel? Reduce speed to 6–8 and health to ~1500.

## Version History
- v1.1.0: Scope reduced to Pentecenter only; metadata updated.
- v1.0.0: Original multi-ship enhancement (deprecated).
