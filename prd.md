## PRD: Pentecenter Trade Booster

### 1. Goal
Provide a single focused enhancement to the civilian Pentecenter (GUID 37222) to improve trade route efficiency and survivability without altering other Roman ships.

### 2. Scope
In-scope: Existing Pentecenter properties (cargo, movement, health, build time, modules) already set in `assets.xml`.
Out-of-scope: Any changes to Trireme (37223), Quinquireme (37224), costs, maintenance, asset pools, or additional new properties.

### 3. Current Modified Stats (Retained)
- Cargo Slots: 9
- Base Speed: 24.0 | Accel: 2 | Decel: 1.5 | Rotation: 60
- Module Slots: 2
- Health: 4000
- Build Time: 10 seconds

### 4. Rationale
High cargo + extreme speed minimize turnaround time on trade loops. Reinforced health (4000) prevents easy loss to incidental attacks while remaining a non-combat civilian vessel. Keeping module slots at 2 avoids excessive customization impact.

### 5. Non-Goals
- Do not balance speed downward at this time.
- Do not introduce upkeep or cost adjustments.
- Do not touch other ship GUIDs or broader naval balance.

### 6. Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Speed 24 may trivialize logistics. Mitigation: User may manually lower `<BaseSpeed>` later if desired.
- Risk: High health could encourage misuse in combat. Mitigation: No offensive stat changes; modules limited to 2.
- Risk: Fast build time (10s) could inflate early economy scaling. Mitigation: Single ship type only; player discretion.

### 7. Testing Checklist
1. Build a new Pentecenter after enabling mod.
2. Verify cargo UI shows 9 slots without layout issues.
3. Confirm movement speed visually vs vanilla comparison.
4. Simulate minor combat encounter; ensure durability feels increased.
5. Confirm other ships retain vanilla stats.

### 8. Success Metrics
- Player reports reduced route cycle times.
- No crashes or UI anomalies (cargo slots render properly).
- Other ships unaffected.

### 9. Future Optional Adjustments (Not Planned Now)
- Tone speed down to 6–8 for balance.
- Adjust cargo to 6–8 if UI issues or economy distortion appear.
- Add cost scaling to offset performance.

### 10. Version
Reflected in `modinfo.json` as 1.1.0 (scope reduction to only Pentecenter).
